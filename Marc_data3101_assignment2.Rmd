## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Two issues have been identified in the catalog of “mock” galaxies, a catalog authored by Fabio Zandanel, a postdoc at the University of Amsterdam. These issues include a mass conversion problem and the allocation of the gas-fraction quantity for each object, both of which were omissions in a significant code. These errors impacted two papers, in addition, multiple tables and figure were incorrect. However, the most fortunate and interesting aspect of this situation is that it had no impact on the final outcome as both errors canceled each other. Nevertheless, although the final conclusion remains unaffected by these errors, it is imperative to rectify these minor inaccuracies, as this data may be used for other research purposes.
By considering the research data lifecycle, it seems that the researchers of that article faced problems in the step of “Process/analyze/interpret data”
